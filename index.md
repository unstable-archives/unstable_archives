<p>This born-digital archive records a collection of letters, textiles, jewelry, paintings and other items connected to the life of Elizabeth Sharaf un-Nisa Ducarel (1758-1822), a Mughal woman who was born in the South Asian subcontinent and relocated to Devonshire, England to live with the English man who would become her husband and their children. This archive includes five curated exhibits, an interactive timeline shedding more light on the life and times of Elizabeth Sharaf un-Nisa and her family, a reader’s guide for the collection, and teaching resources. You can also browse the collection using media descriptors and keywords.</p>
<p>The archive also will be ingested into the University of Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://openn.library.upenn.edu/CuratedCollections.html">OPenn</a> archive. The imaging and digitization of Elizabeth Sharaf un-Nisa’s materials has been made possible by the Palmer Family’s loan of their ancestor’s archival materials, and grants from the <a href="https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/funding/internal/jff">John Fell Fund</a> at the University of Oxford, the Penn <a href="https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/">Price Lab</a>, and from the <a href="https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior_1col.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=420&sitebuilder=1&contentbuilder=1">Trustees' Council for Penn Women</a>.</p>
